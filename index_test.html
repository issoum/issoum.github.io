                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I’m a Quantitative Analyst with a solid foundation in Applied Mathematics and Quantitative Finance, 
                        holding an engineering degree in Financial Engineering from Ensimag, 
                        a Msc in Quantitative Finance from IAE Grenoble, and a Bachelor’s in Mathematics and 
                        Computer Science from Université Grenoble Alpes.
                        Since January 2025, I’ve been with the RISQ/MDL team at Société Générale, focusing on developing and enhancing risk models, 
                        including integrating climate-related factors. During my internship at Amundi,
                        I implemented scenario probability allocation in discounted cash flow (DCF) models to calculate the market value of 
                        companies under various climate transition scenarios, incorporating market-assigned probabilities for accelerated and 
                        current transition trends. I also co-authored a research paper on climate risk modeling, 
                        specifically on the impact of carbon prices on the profitability of companies.
                        My expertise includes stochastic calculus, time series analysis, 
                        portfolio management, derivatives pricing,
                        and numerical optimization. I am proficient in Python, Java, C++, C# and R, 
                        with hands-on experience in statistical modeling and advanced inferential statistics.
                        In addition to my professional work, I build automated cryptocurrency strategies, 
                        reflecting my ongoing interest in algorithmic trading</p>
